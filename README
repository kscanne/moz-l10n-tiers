This repo creates a "pseudo-locale" for Mozilla products in order to
show the priority level of different strings for localization.

After cloning this repo, do this once:
$ make clone

And then after each rapid release cycle:
$ make tiers-update.txt

If diff looks ok:
$ mv tiers-update.txt tiers.txt

To iterate, make tweaks to tiers.txt, then:
$ make

And then do a build of the updated pseudo-locale and test.
